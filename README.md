Prelim Activity 02: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming and Robustness

Israel Andy Maliwat

Overview: This lab bridges the gap between abstract architectural design and professional technical execution. Students will evolve from basic scripting to Systems Design by implementing the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism, alongside robust Exception Handling.

Task Description: The Clean‑Water Treatment Plant simulation is a C# console app built to demonstrate the four pillars of OOP. A base class WaterFilter defines shared members, while CarbonFilter and ChemicalFilter inherit and override methods to show inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. Encapsulation is enforced through private fields and validated properties, and robustness is achieved with try‑catch blocks that handle divide‑by‑zero, invalid input, and unexpected errors, ensuring safe and graceful program execution.
